"""910C precision tests for ``gmm_swiglu_quant_v2_layered``.

Build the extension against an Ascend 910C toolchain, then run::

    SOC_VERSION=910c AFD_RUN_ASCEND_OP_RUNTIME=1 \
        pytest tests/npu/test_gmm_swiglu_quant_v2_layered_precision.py

Two reference strategies are used, because only one of the two quantization
scenarios has a usable built-in counterpart.

``a8w8`` compares against the built-in non-layered
``torch_npu.npu_grouped_matmul_swiglu_quant_v2``, fed the selected layer's
weight, scale and assist matrix as a single-element list. Both are ACLNN
operators of the same family driven with byte-identical inputs, so a direct
comparison is a valid differential precision test.

``a8w4`` compares against a CPU golden implemented in this file, following the
formula already exercised on device by
``tests/npu/test_async_cam_layered_w4a8.py``: dequantize the int4 weights,
per-expert matmul, SiLU gating, then per-token quantization. The built-in cannot
serve as the reference for this scenario, and the reason is worth recording
precisely.

**Why A8W4 needs a golden.** For an int32 weight carrying packed int4,
``npu_grouped_matmul_swiglu_quant_v2`` derives the output width from the
weight's own last dimension - ``n = weight[0].size(2)`` in
``torch_npu/op_plugin/meta/_meta_registrations.py``, and the matching C++ N
inference in ``op-plugin/.../GroupedMatmulSwigluQuantV2NpuOpapi.cpp`` - which
for an ``[E, K, N // 8]`` int32 weight is ``N // 8``, while the ACLNN kernel
unpacks the int4 values and therefore expects ``N``. Measured directly against
the meta registration::

    int8  [E, K, N]      size(2) = 256 -> output [128, 128]  (agrees with kernel)
    int32 [E, K, N // 8] size(2) =  32 -> output [128,  16]  (kernel wants 128)

The framework therefore allocates an output eight times too narrow and the
ACLNN call fails with ``Expected tensor for gmmDsqParams_.output to have same
size as [128, 128], but got [128, 16]``. The mismatch is in the N derivation,
not in the NZ layout, so no input construction works around it: an unpacked
ND int32 tensor of the same logical shape reproduces it. That is a torch_npu
limitation, out of scope for this repository, which is why ``a8w4`` is checked
against a golden instead.

Two layers with distinct weights and scales are exercised so a wrong
``layer_index`` cannot pass unnoticed, every invocation gets its own activation
clone (the A8W4 MSD path may modify ``x`` in place), and each case reports its
seed, shapes, scenario, mode, layer, repeat, both maximum absolute errors and
the int8 mismatch count.

**Each attribute combination gets its own shape, deliberately.** The tiling is
cached per shape and tiling key, and neither ``group_list_type`` nor
``dequant_mode`` is part of that key - both reach the tiling only as data, and the
A8W8 fusion path pins a constant key (``A8W8_FUSION_KEY_MODE = 3``). Running two
combinations at one shape in the same process therefore makes the second inherit
the first one's tiling *and its attribute values*. That is not hypothetical: it
is what made this suite report a failure when the operator was in fact correct.
An A8W4 ``type=0`` case tiled first, an A8W8 ``type=1`` case inherited that
tiling, and the kernel then differenced token counts that were already counts -
writing 44 of 128 rows and leaving the rest of the capacity-sized output
uninitialized. The single-process log confirmed the mechanism: four calls
carrying four different attribute values produced exactly one ``PrintTilingData``
line. ``_COUNT_PATTERNS`` and ``test_variant_shapes_are_distinct`` keep the
combinations independent; ``test_a8w8_group_list_type_is_independent_of_call_order``
re-runs both values in both orders so a regression fails either way.

# Every (dequant_mode, group_list_type) combination gets its own activation

#
# Both attributes reach the tiling only as tiling *data*. The A8W8 fusion path
# sets a constant tiling key (`A8W8_FUSION_KEY_MODE = 3`) and the cache key does
# not include `group_list_type` or `dequant_mode`, so a second call with the same
# shape reuses the first call's tiling - and with it the first call's attribute
# value. Measured on device: four calls carrying four different
# `group_list_type` values but one shape produced exactly one
# `PrintTilingData` line, i.e. the tiling ran once and the later calls inherited
# it. An out-of-range probe consequently looked "accepted" because the validation
# never re-ran, and a `type=1` case failed only because a `type=0` case had been
# tiled first - the kernel then differenced counts that were not cumulative and
# left the tail of the output unwritten.
#
# Varying the shape per combination forces a fresh tiling and keeps the
# combinations independent inside one process. The row counts stay non-uniform
# per expert so a wrong expert offset is still visible, and each pattern's entries
# differ from each other so differencing them does not reproduce them - which is

# the golden stays in fp32 throughout. One fp16 unit roundoff is 2**-11 and the

# roundoffs is the expected magnitude.
#
# Measured on Ascend 910C over all four (dequant_mode, group_list_type)
# combinations and both layers: the per-token scale carries 1.8e-03 to 2.1e-03 of
# relative error, about 4 fp16 unit roundoffs, against scales of order 1e-6. The
# bound is set at 16 unit roundoffs, roughly 3.6x the worst observation, so a
# different seed or shape has room without the check becoming vacuous - it still
# rejects any error of the percent scale that a real defect produces. Note the
# absolute figure in the log (~4e-09) looks far smaller than the bound only

# Measured maximum absolute difference is 2.4e-06 to 5.6e-06, one LSB wide and
# therefore consistent with the `int8_max_lsb_delta = 1` above rather than an
# independent error. `assert_close` bounds by `atol + rtol * |reference|`, so
# atol=2e-05 leaves roughly 3.6x margin at the smallest magnitudes and more at
